[Zig cookbook](https://github.com/zigcc/zig-cookbook) is a collection of simple Zig programs that demonstrate good practices to accomplish common programming tasks.

> - Main branch tracks Zig 0.15.x, and is tested on Linux and macOS via GitHub actions.
> - Earlier Zig support could be found in [other branches](https://github.com/zigcc/zig-cookbook/branches).

# How to use

[The website](https://cookbook.ziglang.cc/) is generated by [zine-ssg](https://zine-ssg.io), a static site generator for Zig. `zine` will start a server at `http://localhost:1990` for preview.

Each recipe is accompanied by an illustrative example named after its corresponding sequence number. These examples can be executed using the command `zig build run-{chapter-num}-{sequence-num}`, or `zig build run-all` to execute all.

> ## Note
>
> Some recipes may depend on system libraries
>
> - Use `make install-deps` to install client libraries, and
> - `docker-compose up -d` to start required databases.
