As with [previous section](14-01-sqlite), here we introduce [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/libpq-example.html) interface directly, other than [wrapper package](https://github.com/tonis2/zig-postgres).

Data models used in this demo are the same with the one used in [SQLite section](14-01-sqlite).

> Note: After executing a query with `PQexec` like functions, if there are returning results, check the result with `PGRES_TUPLES_OK`, otherwise `PGRES_COMMAND_OK` should be used.
