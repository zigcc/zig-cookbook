When we want to mutate data shared between threads, [`Mutex`](**Mut**ually **ex**clusive flag) must be used to synchronize threads, otherwise the result maybe unexpected.

[]($code.siteAsset('src/07-02.zig').language('zig'))
If we remove Mutex protection, the result will most like be less than 30,000.
