[`Instant`] represents a timestamp with respect to the currently executing program that ticks while the program is suspended and can be used to record elapsed time.

Calling [`std.time.Instant.since`] returns a u64 representing nanoseconds elapsed.

This is such a common task, that there is a [`Timer`] for convenience.
