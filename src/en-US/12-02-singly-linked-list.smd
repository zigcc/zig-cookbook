[Singly linked list] contains nodes linked together. The list contains:
- `head`, head of the list, used for traversal.
- `tail`, tail of the list, used for fast add.
- `len`, length of the list

Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include:
- Insertion O(1)
- Deletion O(n), which is the most complex since it needs to maintain head/tail pointer.
- Traversal O(n)
