The fields of a [packed struct](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#packed-struct) are always laid out in memory in the order they are written, with no padding, so they are very nice to represent a bitfield.

Boolean values are represented as 1 bit in a packed struct, Zig also has arbitrary bit-width integers, like u28, u1 and so on.
