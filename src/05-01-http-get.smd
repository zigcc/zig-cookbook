Parses the supplied URL and makes a synchronous HTTP GET request
with [`request`]. Prints obtained [`Response`] status and headers.

> Note: Since HTTP support is in early stage, it's recommended to use [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/) for any complex task.
> And when the buffer is not enough, it will return `error.HttpHeadersOverSize`
