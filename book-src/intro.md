[Zig cookbook](https://github.com/zigcc/zig-cookbook) is a collection of simple Zig programs that demonstrate good practices to accomplish common programming tasks.

# How to use

[The website](https://zigcc.github.io/zig-cookbook/) is generated by [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), `mdbook serve` will start a server at `http://localhost:3000` for preview.

Each recipe is accompanied by an illustrative example named after its corresponding sequence number. These examples can be executed using the command `zig build run-{chapter-num}-{sequence-num}`, or `zig build run-all` to execute all.

> - Support Zig 0.11.0 and master, and they are tested on Linux and macOS via GitHub actions.
> - Some recipes may depend on system libraries, use `make install-deps` to install them.

> Note: Some recipes can't compile in 0.11.0, so they are skipped in CI.
